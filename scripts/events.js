    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>: Roller coasters are thrill rides that operates like a railroad track. The history
of this ride reflects a constant search for greater and more death-defying thrills. They are made
from steel or wood and comprise a series of hills and drops, sudden turns, track loops and
corkscrew-like elements. Roller coasters don’t have engines, they must be pulled by a
motorized chain to the top of the first big hill. As the roller coaster rises higher, its potential
energy increases and reaches maximum at crest of hill. The potential energy accumulated by
the rise in height is transferred to kinetic energy as the cars race down the first downward slope.
Teams shall design and build a “roller coaster” meeting the requirements specified in these
rules. The “roller coaster” shall mean the entire structure, including the roller coaster track and
the base, but not the actual vehicle. The “COASTER” shall mean the vehicle that travels on the
Roller Coaster track.<br>
<h2>MATERIALS TO BE PROVIDED:</h2> Ply board (2m*1.5m), Tape, Fevicol and Scissor.<br>
<h2>Roller Coaster Model Rules</h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Size restrictions -a the height should not be more than 2m.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) The model should be designed for a regular size, steel or glass marble.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) The starting position at the top of the first hill should be clearly marked.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) You will have to measure the total track length and mention it somewhere on the track.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) Your team may use more than one marble.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f) The use of electricity during the competition is prohibited.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g) Magnets are permitted without restrictions. However, electromagnets are prohibited.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;h) Only gravity and magnetism may be used to propel the “COASTER”.<br>
